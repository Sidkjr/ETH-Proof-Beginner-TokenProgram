# ETH Token Program

A program made with solidity (0.8.19) that has a Token Minting and Burning functionality

## Description

The program demonstrates the basics of solidity using concepts like smart contracts, variables and their types, mapping, and functions. The program particularly has two functions -
  - Mint Token
  - Burn Token

The Burn function also considers the total supply before burning Tokens using the Conditional Statement concept, as the burn amount should not be more than the total supply.

## Getting Started
